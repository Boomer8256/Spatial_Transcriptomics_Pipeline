## üöÄ Getting Started
Welcome to the **Spatial Transcriptomics Pipeline**. This application enables you to analyze gene expression data from tissue samples. By using our automated pipeline, you can identify cancer hotspots and explore the tumor microenvironment efficiently.

### üìã System Requirements
Before you start, ensure your computer meets the following requirements:

- **Operating System:** Windows 10 or higher, macOS 10.14 or higher, or any recent Linux distribution.
- **Python Version:** Python 3.6 or later.
- **RAM:** Minimum of 4 GB; 8 GB or more is recommended for larger datasets.
- **Disk Space:** At least 500 MB of free space for installation and data processing.

### üîß Features
- **Automated Processing:** Streamlines the analysis of spatial transcriptomics data.
- **Visual Mapping:** Generates visual representations of gene expression in tissues.
- **Flexibility:** Supports various tissue samples and data formats.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Designed for ease of use, even for those without programming knowledge.
